🪑 YOUR SEATING ASSIGNMENT
===========================

Dear {{ first_name }},

We've assigned your seat for our wedding reception. Here are your seating details:

TABLE {{ table.table.table_number }}
{% if table.table.name %}({{ table.table.name }}){% endif %}
{% if table.seat_number %}
Seat #{{ table.seat_number }}
{% endif %}

{% if table.table.location %}
📍 Location: {{ table.table.location }}
{% endif %}

Look for your table when you arrive at the reception. If you have any questions or need special accommodations, please don't hesitate to reach out.

We look forward to celebrating with you!

With love,
The Happy Couple
